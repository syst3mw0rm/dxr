Rust plugin
-----------

Work in progess, not ready for use.

Tracked by https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=956768

This plugin is disabled by default. You need to set disabled plugins to something
other than 'rust' to use it. (TODO that is probably wrong, we need to hardcode it,
so that disable='' -> disabling rust and it needs to be explicitly enabled)

Unlike Clang there is no mechanism for plugins for Rust. So the strategy is to
hack the compiler to output dxr csvs and make it more generic later...

TODO
----

* REBASE

scopes so we can query items in a module, class etc.

* sort out the rhs bar

rename dxr -> dump ...

methods - check static method with specialisation
check extern mod github link

** TODOs

refactor + style

Currently if we index the std_libs, we don't give them the usual std_lib links,
we should give them the docs link in addition to the local links. This would
currently break things I think.

bugs
----

text search - case sensitivity bug - the 'i' in the search query screws things up
  update libtrilite

macros give overlapping extents

items
-----

type param defs + refs
lifetime param defs + refs
...

pelmers
-------

enums (jump to def, find uses of each, find all uses)
  variant refs should get values on hover
match (adds var decls)
